**Deprecation warning:** I have moved to [a new extension](https://github.com/pwxn/XLineTool) and will no longer be maintaining this

XcodeKit
========

Extra features for working with adding and removing lines in Xcode

#### Features (added to Editor menu)
- Delete Selection / Line
- Duplicate Selection / Line
- New Line After Current
- CRLF to LF in Selection

#### Install from source
- Clone the source
- Build Target: XcodeKit8App
- Copy the Application from products somewhere permanent (ie ~/Applications)
- Run that Application, then quit it. (it does nothing but must be run once)
- Open system preferences, Extensions tab, check box to allow XcodeKit8App
- Restart Xcode

The commands will appear under the menu Editor > XCodeKit8App
You can set the shortcuts for these commands from Xcode preferences
